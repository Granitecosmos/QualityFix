# Quality Fix
Have you ever wondered why you're drowning in silver lategame (other than for organ harvesting, of course)? Have you ever done the math behind the quality system?

Let me tell you the difference between a Normal Charge Rifle and a Legendary Charge Rifle. The latter has 50% more DPS while it has a market value multiplier of 600%! Do you see the problem already?

Well fear not, for I bring you Quality Fix!

Believe me, I've done the math and I can tell you one thing for sure: avoid legendary weapons/apparel like the plague!
In a game wehere the most troublesome event (a.k.a. Raid) is determined by the total market value of your colonies, you should always try to get as much stats as you can for as low additional value as you can. It's simple logic, right?

Now, let's compare Legendary to Normal. Let's say that we have two colonists. Your average "worth-to-keep" colonist will probably have a value of ~2000. Now let's give one a Normal Charge Rifle and the other one a Legendary Charge Rifle. Former now has a total value of 2945 with a DPS of 1X, while latter has a total value of 7670 with a DPS of 1.5X. This means, ladies and gentlemen, that I'm better off with 2 pawns using Normal Charge Rifles than with one pawn using a Legendary Charge Rifle! And then we didn't even account for the armor!

The problem with quality market price scaling in RimWorld is that it works backward. Instead of producing items with better value-to-stat ratios, higher quality weapons/armors give worse and worse ratios the higher we go. So the higher quality gear you use, the more you shoot yourself in the foot! Surely an intended behavior, right?

Now, you could argue that one does not simply get more pawns easily in RimWorld, especially if they don't prefer Randy. The problem, however, still remains. More value, bigger Raids. Anything over Exceptional is simply not worth it. Luckily, this can be easily fixed!

All this mod does is change the market value scaling of quality from 0.4-0.6-0.8-1-1.2-1.5-2-3-6 to 0.4-0.6-0.8-1-1.1-1.2-1.3-1.4-1.5 so now most weapons retain their Normal value-to-stat ratios, while higher quality armors are now straight up always better.

# Balance
Trickier than you'd think. Lower values mean less severe Raids, especially lategame, but Raiders can spawn with better stuff more frequently too. This also affects money generation via anything that produces things with quality. So unless your export consists merely of organs and drugs, you'll need more time to amass the same amount of silver you used to have.
 
# Compatibility
Any mod that changes the market value scaling of quality will be obviously incompatible.
